# JavaScript Fundamentals: Console Finances
Challenge 4 : This activity presents a real-world situation.
I'll be using the concepts that I've learned to create a financial analysis tool.

# Project Requirements:
 * Create a new GitHub repo called Console-Finances. Then, clone it to your computer.

 * Copy the starter files into your local git repository.
  
 The task is to write JavaScript code that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:
   * The total number of months included in the dataset.
   * The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.
   * The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.
     * You will need to track what the total change in profits is from month to month and then find the average.
     * (Total/(Number of months - 1))
   * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.
   * The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

# Description of this Project:
This challenge utilizes the concepts learned in Javascript fundamentals to address a real-world example. The task was to create code for analyzing the financial records of a company from a financial dataset which was provided.

Skills used include psuedocoding, variables, for loops, math, multidimensional arrays and conditional logic.

JavaScript code that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:
 * The total number of months included in the dataset.
 * The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.
 * The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.
 * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.
 * The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

# Technologies Used:
 * HTML
 * Javascript
 * Web-Developer Tool (Console)
